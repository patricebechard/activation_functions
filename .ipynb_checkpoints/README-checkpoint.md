# Activation Functions

I tried to train a MLP on MNIST using various activation functions. These activation functions are :

* Sine
* Cosine
* LeakyTanh
* SimSqrt
* ReLU
* ReSU
* ReLogU

**See `main.ipynb` for the mathematical interpretation of these activation functions.** I am not able to render LaTeX equation in the README...

------------------------

### TODO
* Provide visualisation of the various activation functions
* Provide performance of the various activation functions
